                storyline: "You play as Geralt of Rivia, a legendary monster slayer known as a Witcher, in a massive open world filled with warring kingdoms, mythical beasts and complex characters. After years of searching, you finally locate your missing adopted daughter Ciri - who is being relentlessly pursued by the spectral Wild Hunt. Your choices shape the political landscape and determine who survives in this dark fantasy epic where there are no true 'good' or 'evil' paths, just difficult decisions with far-reaching consequences.",
                tips: "The Quen sign (shield) is vital for survival against tough enemies - keep it active. Different Witcher gear sets (Cat, Bear, Griffin, Wolf) each have unique bonuses - complete the scavenger hunts to get them. Some Gwent cards are permanently missable if you don't get them during certain quests. Visit notice boards for contracts that level you up and pay well. Roach will conveniently appear when you whistle, even on cliffs. Potions and oils become extremely powerful when upgraded through alchemy."

The game explores themes of loyalty, redemption, and the brutal reality of a changing world through an emotionally gripping narrative where your choices affect Arthur's morality and relationships with over 50 unique characters.",
                tips: "For perfect pelts, use the appropriate weapon (study animals first to see recommendations) and aim for clean kills - a scoped rifle works best for most large animals. Camp upgrades improve morale and unlock useful features - the fast travel map is particularly valuable for exploring this massive world. High honor reduces shop prices by up to 50% and unlocks special outfits/dialogue options. Dead Eye targeting is crucial in shootouts - upgrade it at the gunsmith. Greet people in towns to slowly increase honor."

The world is packed with deadly creatures, demigod rulers with tragic backstories, and deep lore about the Golden Order and its mysterious origins.",
                tips: "Thorough exploration reveals powerful weapons, spells and upgrade materials - check behind every ruin and cliffside. Weapons that cause bleed buildup (like Rivers of Blood or Moonveil) are currently meta for PvE and PvP. Spirit ashes can trivialize tough boss fights - upgrade them at Roderika. Jump attacks break enemy poise quickly. Save smithing stones for weapons you'll use long-term. The jellyfish summon is surprisingly tanky against early bosses. Level vigor first - you'll need the health."
